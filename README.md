# Hi, I'm Swarup! 👋

A passionate **Frontend Developer** and **Computer Engineer** from Nepal with experience in building user-friendly digital solutions. I specialize in developing modern web applications using **React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Currently working as a **Frontend Engineer at Inductiv**, I enjoy transforming complex challenges into seamless, intuitive user experiences.

With a background in both **frontend and backend development** (Node.js, Express.js, Django) and **UI/UX design**, I bring a holistic approach to creating impactful solutions. As a former graphics designer, I blend creativity with code to deliver engaging digital experiences.

I'm committed to continuous learning and staying current with evolving technologies. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new frameworks, contributing to projects, and sharing knowledge with fellow developers.
